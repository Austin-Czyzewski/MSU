Repository for projects and homework sets done at Michigan State University

This is project 1 of my AST 304 course at MSU, the Orbits and Energies script will output plots
from the integration methods that we created. This will show the change in accuracy of a program
given changes in timestep and integration method.

The integration methods created here are the Euler method, RK2, and RK4
